# Testing Data Types  
(Applied to Automotive Center-Stack Stability Testing)

## 1. Why Data Types Matter in Stability Testing

In stability testing, data types are **not a coding detail** — they are a **design decision**.

Choosing the wrong data type leads to:
- Incorrect aggregations
- Invalid comparisons
- Misleading trends
- Silent data corruption

Once incorrect data types enter the pipeline, downstream analysis becomes unreliable.

## 2. Core Principle

> **Data type defines what questions you can safely ask of the data.**

If the data type is wrong, even correct code will produce incorrect conclusions.

---

## 3. Common Data Generated by Center-Stack Stability Testing

Center-stack stability tests generate heterogeneous data over long durations:

- Execution metadata
- System metrics
- UI performance signals
- Failure events
- Resource usage over time

Each must be modeled with the **correct data type**.

## 4. Recommended Data Types (With Rationale)

| Stability Artifact | Correct Data Type | Reason |
|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| Test case ID | String | Identifier, not numeric |
| Iteration number | Integer | Discrete sequence |
| Execution timestamp | Datetime | Time-series analysis |
| Test status | Categorical (String / Enum) | Finite states |
| Execution duration | Float | Precision required |
| UI response time | Float | Thresholds and percentiles |
| Memory usage (MB) | Float | Trend analysis |
| ANR count | Integer | Aggregation |
| Service restart count | Integer | Frequency |
| Recovery action taken | Boolean / Categorical | Decision tracking |
| Log message | Text | Unstructured data |

---

## 5. Mental Model for Data-Type Selection

Ask these questions before choosing a data type:

1. Will I **compare** this value?
2. Will I **aggregate** this value?
3. Will I **track it over time**?
4. Will I **categorize** it?
5. Will I **store free-form text**?

Your answers dictate the correct type.

## 6. Stability Testing Examples

### Example 1: Execution Time

❌ Wrong  
- Stored as `"12.5"` (string)

Problems:
- Cannot compute averages
- Cannot apply thresholds
- Cannot detect trends

✅ Correct  
- Stored as `12.5` (float)

---

### Example 2: Test Status

❌ Wrong  
- Encoded as numeric values without meaning (`0`, `1`, `2`)

Problems:
- Reduces readability
- Increases interpretation errors

✅ Correct  
- Categorical values (`PASS`, `FAIL`, `CRASH`, `TIMEOUT`)

---

### Example 3: Memory Usage Over Time

❌ Wrong  
- Stored as discrete snapshots without timestamps

Problems:
- No trend analysis
- Cannot correlate with failures

✅ Correct  
- Float values indexed by timestamp or iteration

---

## 7. Common Mistakes Testers Make

- Storing numeric data as strings
- Comparing floats using equality
- Mixing counts and durations in the same field
- Using lists where key-value mapping is required
- Ignoring time as a first-class data dimension

These mistakes are especially damaging in long-run stability testing.

---

## 8. How Data Types Enable Advanced Analysis

Correct data types enable:
- Failure-rate computation
- Percentile-based UI latency analysis
- Memory-leak detection
- Correlation across metrics
- Reliable visualization

Machine Learning and AI depend entirely on **correct foundational data types**.

## 9. Interview Perspective

> “In automotive center-stack stability testing, choosing the correct data type is a design decision.  
It determines whether trend analysis, aggregation, and prediction are even possible.”
