# Phase 0 — Foundations

Phase 0 establishes the conceptual and environmental foundations required before writing data science code.

This phase focuses on:
- Understanding what Data Science is (and is not)
- Translating stability testing problems into data problems
- Identifying correct data types generated by testing systems
- Avoiding common testing-to-data mistakes
- Ensuring tooling and environments are reproducible

No advanced Python or libraries are used here.
The goal is **clarity of thinking before execution**.
