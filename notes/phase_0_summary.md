# Phase 0 Summary — Foundations Complete

## Objective
Phase 0 focused on setting up a clean, reproducible Data Science environment
and building conceptual clarity before writing analysis-heavy code.

The goal was to avoid the common mistake of rushing into tools without
understanding where Data Science fits and how it applies to my background
in stability testing.

## What I Completed

### Environment & Tooling
- Installed Python (via Conda)
- Verified Jupyter Notebook setup
- Configured VS Code / PyCharm
- Validated Git and GitHub workflow
- Created reproducible environment file

### Conceptual Foundations
- Understood **Data Analytics vs Data Science**
- Differentiated **DS vs ML vs AI**
- Identified data generated from stability testing:
  - Logs
  - Iteration metrics
  - Failures, crashes, execution time
- Mapped testing problems to data problems

---

## Key Learnings
- Data Science starts with **problem framing**, not algorithms
- Clean data and reproducibility matter more than models
- Testing data is naturally time-series and event-driven
- Documentation is as important as code in real projects

---

## Exit Criteria Checklist
- [x] Python and Jupyter working
- [x] GitHub repo created and maintained
- [x] Concepts documented, not memorized
- [x] Able to explain DS relevance to testing
- [x] Repo is clean and structured

## Readiness for Phase 1
I am now ready to begin Phase 1, which will focus on:
- Python fundamentals
- Reading and processing CSV/log data
- Writing analysis-ready code
- Building toward exploratory data analysis

**Phase 0 is officially complete.**
