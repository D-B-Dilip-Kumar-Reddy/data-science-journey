# Data Science Journey

## Overview
This repository documents my structured journey into **Data Science and Machine Learning**, with the goal of **upskilling and transitioning into a new domain**.


My background is in **stability and automation testing**, where I work with long-running test executions, large volumes of logs, and repeated failures and crashes. Through this journey, I aim to apply data-driven approaches to problems traditionally handled through manual or rule-based analysis.

## Why I’m Learning Data Science

My intent in learning Data Science and ML is to **enhance my skill set and enable a domain shift**.

As a Stability Test Engineer, I routinely analyze:
- Iteration-based test runs
- Execution time trends
- Failures, crashes, and intermittent defects
- Large, unstructured log files

With increasing test scale, I realized that **manual analysis does not scale** and often misses hidden patterns.  
I believe **Data Science and Machine Learning can significantly simplify error and defect classification**, helping identify recurring issues and trends faster and more accurately.

## How This Connects to Testing & Automation

Stability testing produces rich datasets that are ideal candidates for data analysis and machine learning.

Examples:
- Test logs → datasets
- Error messages → features
- Failure types → labels
- Iterations → time-series data

By applying Data Science techniques, I aim to:
- Automatically classify errors and defects
- Cluster similar failures together
- Detect regressions early
- Predict test instability before failures occur

This represents a shift from **reactive debugging** to **proactive, data-driven insights**.

## Testing ↔ Data Science Mapping

| Testing Concept | Data Science / ML Equivalent |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| Test logs | Dataset |
| Execution metrics | Features |
| Failures / crashes | Labels |
| Repeated defects | Patterns |
| Stability issues | Trends |
| Root cause analysis | Model inference |
| Manual triage | Automated classification |

## Project Goals

- Build a strong foundation in Python for data analysis
- Learn core Data Science concepts and workflows
- Apply ML techniques to real-world test data
- Reduce manual effort in failure and defect triaging
- Create reusable tools for analyzing stability test results

## Learning Approach

- **Hands-on first**: Code, analyze, visualize
- **Testing-driven examples**: Use real testing scenarios
- **Incremental learning**: Fundamentals → Applied ML
- **Documentation-focused**: Track learnings and outcomes
